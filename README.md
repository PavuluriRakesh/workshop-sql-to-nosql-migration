1. [Create your Astra Instance](#1-create-your-astra-instance)
2. [Create petclinic NoSQL data model](#2-create-petclinic-nosql-data-model)
3. [Generate your Astra application token](#3-generate-your-astra-application-token)
4. [Load data into Astra with DSBulk](#4-transform-and-load-data-with-dsbulk)

## 1. Create your Astra instance

`ASTRA` service is available at url [https://astra.datastax.com](https://dtsx.io/workshop). `ASTRA` is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. **No credit card or any payment required**, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - **sufficient to run small production workloads**.

### ‚úÖ Step 1a. Register (if needed) and Sign In to Astra** : You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.

Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character

### ‚úÖ Step 1b. Create a "pay as you go" plan

Follow this [guide](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/creating-your-astra-database.html) and use the values provided below, to set up a pay as you go database with a **FREE** $25 monthly credit.

| Parameter | Value 
|---|---|
| Database name | sql_to_nosql_db |
| Keyspace name | spring_petclinic |

## 2. Create petclinic NoSQL data model
Ok, now that you have a database created the next step is to create a tables to work with.

### ‚úÖ Step 2a. Navigate to the CQL Console and login to the database

In the Summary screen for your database, select **_CQL Console_** from the top menu in the main window. This will take you to the CQL Console and automatically log you in.


### ‚úÖ Step 2b. Describe keyspaces and USE killrvideo

Ok, now we're ready to rock. Creating tables is quite easy, but before we create one we need to tell the database which keyspace we are working with.

First, let's **_DESCRIBE_** all of the keyspaces that are in the database. This will give us a list of the available keyspaces.

üìò **Command to execute**
```
desc KEYSPACES;
```
_"desc" is short for "describe", either is valid_

üìó **Expected output**

![Screen Shot 2021-04-06 at 2 11 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/113758501-f5c3f400-96e1-11eb-8f40-4eb2c9b8c2c4.png)

Depending on your setup you might see a different set of keyspaces then in the image. The one we care about for now is **_spring_petclinic_**. 

From here, execute the **_USE_** command with the **_spring_petclinic_** keyspace to tell the database our context is within **_spring_petclinic_**.

üìò **Command to execute**
```
use spring_petclinic;
```

üìó **Expected output**

![Screen Shot 2021-04-06 at 2 12 24 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/113758637-2015b180-96e2-11eb-85f0-a53c9a6a604a.png)

Notice how the prompt displays ```token@cqlsh:spring_petclinic>``` informing us we are **using** the **_spring_petclinic_** keyspace. Now we are ready to create our tables.

### ‚úÖ 2c. Create tables

- *Execute the following Cassandra Query Language. Copy and paste the following statements into your CQL Console* 

üìò **Command to execute**

```sql
use spring_petclinic;

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS petclinic_idx_vetname;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS petclinic_idx_ownername;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_vet;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_vet_by_specialty;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_reference_lists;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_owner;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_pet_by_owner;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_visit_by_pet;

/** A vet can have multiple specialties. */
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_vet (
  id          uuid,
  first_name  text,
  last_name   text,
  specialties set<text>,
  PRIMARY KEY ((id))
);


/** We could search veterinarian by their names. */
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_idx_vetname ON petclinic_vet(last_name);

/** We may want to list all radiologists. */
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_vet_by_specialty (
 specialty   text,
 vet_id      uuid,
 first_name  text,
 last_name   text,
 PRIMARY KEY ((specialty), vet_id)
);

/** 
 * Here we want all values on a single node, avoiding full scan. 
 * We pick am unordered set to avoid duplication, list to be sorted at ui side. 
 */
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_reference_lists (
  list_name text,
  values set<text>,
  PRIMARY KEY ((list_name))
);

/** Expecting a combobox list references all specialties. */
INSERT INTO petclinic_reference_lists(list_name, values) 
VALUES ('vet_specialty', {'radiology', 'dentistry', 'surgery'});

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_owner (
  id         uuid,
  first_name text,
  last_name  text,
  address    text,
  city       text,
  telephone  text,
  PRIMARY KEY ((id))
);

/** We could search veterinarians by their names. */
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_idx_ownername ON petclinic_owner(last_name);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_pet_by_owner (
  owner_id   uuid,
  pet_id     uuid,
  pet_type   text,
  name       text,
  birth_date date,
  PRIMARY KEY ((owner_id), pet_id)
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_visit_by_pet (
   pet_id      uuid,
   visit_id    uuid,
   visit_date  date,
   description text,
   PRIMARY KEY ((pet_id), visit_id)
);

INSERT INTO petclinic_reference_lists(list_name, values) 
VALUES ('pet_type ', {'bird', 'cat', 'dog', 'lizard','hamster','snake'});
```

- *Visualize structure*
```sql
describe keyspace spring_petclinic;
```

üìó **Expected output**

## 3. Generate your Astra application token
In order for you to securely connect to your Cassandra database on Astra you need to generate an application token. The cool thing once you generate this once you can then use it for any of your applications or tools to talk to your database.

### ‚úÖ 3a. Generate your token
If you don't already have one follow the instructions [**HERE**](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html#_create_application_token) to generate your new token. **Don't forget to download it once created because you will not be able to see it again** without generating a new one.

Once you **DOWNLOAD** the token if you view the contents they should look something like this:

```shell
"Client Id","Client Secret","Token","Role"
"fdsfdslKFdLFdslDFFDjf","aaaaaaadsdadasdasdasdfsadfldsjfldjdsaldjasljdasljdsaljdasljdasljdlasjdal-FLflirFdfl.lfjdfdsljfjdl+fdlffkdsslfd","AstraCS:ppppdspfdsdslfjsdlfjdlj:540524888-04384039399999999999999999","Admin User"
```

You'll need to use this in a moment to authenticate with DSBulk so **keep it handy**.

## 4. Transform and load data with DSBulk
In order to use DSBulk you need to download and install it. While you can do this locally if you would like following the instructions [**HERE**](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/loading-and-unloading-data-with-datastax-bulk-loader.html#_prerequisites) we've already provided it for you using **GitPod**. Click the button below to launch your instance.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Open--in--Gitpod-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-sql-to-nosql-migration)

### ‚úÖ 4a. Load `owner` table SQL export into `petclinic_owner` NoSQL table
Ok, we're going to use DSBulk in this section to: 
- connect to our Astra database using the **CLIENT ID** and **CLIENT SECRET** we created earlier in step 3 and the secure connect bundle `astra-creds.zip`
- load data from the owner.csv file (exported from our relational DB `owner` table)
- do this using a regular **INSERT** statement that maps values from our CSV file while **transforming** data with `UUID()`
- use CSV file headers to identify what data each delimited column contains
- and finally set our delimiter to use ";"

Once this command is constructed it should look something like this:
<img width="1184" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-07 at 8 05 22 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/113863760-0d4dbc00-9778-11eb-95cb-ffdb9742525d.png">

_An example of how to construct the above DSBulk command can be found [**HERE**](https://docs.datastax.com/en/dsbulk/doc/dsbulk/reference/dsbulkLoad.html)._

We've made this a little easier by constructing the command for you. Just run the `dsbulk.sh` script. This will ask for the **CLIENT ID** and **CLIENT SECRET** you created earlier. When it asks, just paste in your value and hit **`ENTER`** to go to the next step.

üìò **Command to execute**
```shell
./dsbulk.sh
```

üìó **Expected output**
![Screen Shot 2021-04-07 at 8 29 07 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/113866689-9c100800-977b-11eb-95dc-b990d268ac9d.png)

Now, go back to `CQL Console` in your Astra UI and view the data from the `petclinic_owner` table.

üìò **Command to execute**
```SQL
SELECT * FROM petclinic_owner;
```

üìó **Expected output**

### ‚úÖ 4b. Let's break this down a bit
So great, you just ran the DSBulk command and something happened, but lets explain this a bit more.

First thing, here is the source CSV we are using generated from our SQL relational database for the `owner` table.
<img width="636" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-07 at 8 11 49 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/113864466-eba10480-9778-11eb-9324-1fe57aedbc9d.png">

## THE END

Congratulation your made it to the END.
